HISTORY:

Initial: July 14, 1999  <SZ><zakons at objectsbydesign.com>

Updated: March 15, 2000 <SZ>

1.  Updated to conform with Version 1.0 W3C 
    Recommendations for XSLT, XPATH, and XHTML based on
    suggestions from Curt Arnold, <Curt.Arnold at hyprotech.com>.
    
2.  Factored out repetitive searching for the type
    of a classifier into a named template called 
    "classify".

3.  No longer creating HTML links to basic data types.
    See the named template "classify" for how this is done.
        
4.  Tested with Xalan/Xerces under Sun's JDK 1.2.2.
    Make sure to get a consistent set of the Apache
    XML libraries. We downloaded Xerces and it included
    Xalan. See http://xml.apache.org/dist/.


Updated: September 12, 2000
Modifications by Stephen Cranefield 
<scranefield at infoscience.otago.ac.nz>.

1.  Converted stylesheet to handle the XMI1.0 DTD for UML1.3 
    (instead of UML1.1)
2.  Used <xsl:key> to improve performance
3.  Handled operations with no parameter of kind 'return' by 
    displaying return type 'void'
4.  Changed treatment of operation parameters so that all 
    operation parameters that aren't of type 'return' are shown, 
    rather than just 'in' parameters
5.  Added display of "specification" classes for a class as 
    UML 1.3 allows realization relationships between classes
6.  The templates for handling parameters were modified to match a 
    Parameter element rather than a Parameter/kind element (i.e. the
    templates are invoked one level higher up the tree, thus avoiding 
    ancestor pattern matching).
    
Note: When processing a realization relationship a check should 
be made that there is a "realize" stereotype on the abstraction
dependency that encodes this relationship. This check has been omitted 
because ArgoUML 0.8 does not correctly serialize the stereotype.

7.  Updated the graphics model using ArgoUML 0.8 <SZ>


Updated: September 20, 2000 <SZ>

1.  Added support for associations between classes.
    Currently showing details for association ends that are not navigable.
    In some models this may be too verbose.
2.  Added support for subtypes. Added support for multiple inheritance.
    Allow generalization for interfaces.
3.  Using the name for the model in the <title> and <h1> tags.
4.  Tested with Xalan 1.1.
5.  Validated XHTML produced with XML Spy 3.0 and with the W3C validator:
    http://validator.w3.org/.   

Updated: January 10, 2001 <SZ>

1.  General cleanup for relaunch of "XMI to HTML" pages and new pages,
    "XSLT by Example".
